## Introduction
The backend of the "Drug Performance Analysis" project provides the necessary infrastructure to interact with the MySQL database. It supports CRUD operations for patients, doctors, drugs, prescriptions, reviews, clinical trials, and adverse events. This backend is implemented in Java and uses JDBC for database connectivity.

## Setup
To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/drug-performance-analysis-backend.git
    cd drug-performance-analysis-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Ensure you have Java and MySQL installed.
    - Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project dependencies. You can download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

3. **Set up the database:**
    - Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    - Create a database for your project:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE drug_performance_analysis;
      ```
    - Configure your database connection in the `db.properties` file (create this file if it doesn't exist):
      ```
      db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/drug_performance_analysis
      db.user=your_db_user
      db.password=your_db_password
      ```

4. **Run the database migrations:**
    - Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables in your database.

5. **Build and run the backend:**
    - Compile your Java project using your preferred IDE or build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
    - Run the main application class to start the backend server.

## Database Schema
The database schema includes the following tables:
- `Patient`
- `Doctor`
- `Drug`
- `Prescription`
- `Reviews`
- `Clinical Trial`
- `Adverse Event`

## API Endpoints
The backend provides the following CRUD operations for each table. Here is a sample of how you might structure these in Java:

### Patients
- Retrieve all patients
- Retrieve a specific patient by ID
- Create a new patient
- Update an existing patient
- Delete a patient

### Doctors
- Retrieve all doctors
- Retrieve a specific doctor by ID
- Create a new doctor
- Update an existing doctor
- Delete a doctor

### Drugs
- Retrieve all drugs
- Retrieve a specific drug by ID
- Create a new drug
- Update an existing drug
- Delete a drug

### Prescriptions
- Retrieve all prescriptions
- Retrieve a specific prescription by ID
- Create a new prescription
- Update an existing prescription
- Delete a prescription

### Reviews
- Retrieve all reviews
- Retrieve a specific review by ID
- Create a new review
- Update an existing review
- Delete a review

### Clinical Trials
- Retrieve all clinical trials
- Retrieve a specific clinical trial by ID
- Create a new clinical trial
- Update an existing clinical trial
- Delete a clinical trial

### Adverse Events
- Retrieve all adverse events
- Retrieve a specific adverse event by ID
- Create a new adverse event
- Update an existing adverse event
- Delete an adverse event
